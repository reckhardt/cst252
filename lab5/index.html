							<h3>Challenges</h3>

							<h4>Robert</h4>
							<p>I didn't have any challenges with this lab, it was fun getting back into JS.</p>
							<h4>Stephanie</h4>
							<p>I didn't really run into any challenges for this lab. It was pretty
							straight forward but there were some experimenting here and there. Such as
							using document.writeln and having it to show up in the browser. We ended
							up figuring out what was going on. My partner added an extra "+" on his
							side of the output, but after that everything was well.</p>

							<h3>Problems</h3>

							<h4>Robert</h4>
							<p>I had a syntax error (extra +) which prevented us from seeing our output initialy. This was
							discovered in the console and fixed.</p>
							<h4>Stephanie</h4>
							<p>Didn't really have any problems happen. Just a minor hold up with the
							JavaScript file. Nothing like double checking to make sure everything is
							good.</p>

							<h3>Results</h3>

							<p>You should be able to access this page if done correctly. Such as
							seeing the index.html file we have created + the program execution.</p>

							<h3>Script Output</h3>
