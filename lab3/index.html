			<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<h3>Subject</h3>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on our
			computer and add index.html files.</p>

				<h3>Challenges</h3>
				<p>For this lab, I didn't really run into any problems. It was pretty easy
				creating the file structure, so I got the hang of it prett quick. The only
				struggle me and my partner really had was just being able to collaborate
				on the same file strucutre within Atom. We ran into a few difficulties
				but were able to figure things out.</p>
				<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>If everything done correctly, this is the final look for this lab. You
				should be able to see the final product.</p>

				<h3>Challenges</h3>
				<p>My main challenge for this Lab was working with Atom and writing css
				without auto-complete like there is in Dreamweaver. I had a problem where
				my image was showing locally but wasnt showing on the hosted site. I've never
				ran into this issue before, I think it's because I'm used
				to Dreamweaver writing my filepaths for me, but other than that and some issues
				with teletype this lab went good.</p>
