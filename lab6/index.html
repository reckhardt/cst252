	<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>

	<div id="contents">

			<div class="text">
					<p>The idea of this lab was to work with our partner and experiment with
					JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>

					<h2>Challenges</h2>

					<h4>Robert</h4>
					<p>I didn't have any challenges with this lab. Everything worked as expected</p>

					<h4>Stephanie</h4>
					<p>I dind't really run into any challenges with this lab, but I did have
					to pay extra attention to what I was typing into the JS file and seeing
					that everything was written correctly.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>

					<h4>Robert</h4>
					<p>I didnt read the instructions close enough for task 1 and I accidentley made
					both of the variables arrays so I had to redo this portion of the lab. Other than that
				the rest of the lab went relatively problem free.</p>

					<h4>Stephanie</h4>
					<p>I had a syntax error on my part which prevented me from seeing my
					output on the page. I checked and checked everything on the file and
					everything seemed perfectly fine until I noticed I was missing a
					parenthesis within my document.writeln. I discovered this after checking
					our professor's JavaScript file he had added onto his lab 6 page.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<h4>Script Output</h4>
